Android app - card based drinking game

Runs project loads best in Unity 2017

A drinking game based off of a quick and simple (reallife) card game some friends made up.
The rules are on the main screen but some have been left off because the game is really meant for me and my friends. 

These are:
1) Max of 8 players 
2) A first card must be drawn by any player before the game starts (primer card)
3) After the primer card has been selected go in the order you entered the names
4) The game will notify you when and who is supposed to drink incase someone forgets who's turn it is
5) The if someone becomes the "drink drink" everyone must drink when that person has to drink
